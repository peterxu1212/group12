\maketitle
\section{Introduction}(5+sentences)
Context, Project Task, Data set, findings (abstract 2.0)
\section{Related Work}(4+sentences)
Summarize Literature
\section{Dataset and Setup}(3+sentences)
Very briefly describe the dataset and any basic data pre-processing
methods that are common to all your approaches (e.g., tokenizing). Note: You do not need to explicitly verify that the data satisfies the i.i.d. assumption (or any of the other formal assumptions for linear
classification).
\section{Proposed Approach}(7+sentences)
Briefly describe the different models you implemented/compared
and the features you designed, providing citations as necessary. If you use or build upon an existing
model based on previously published work, it is essential that you properly cite and acknowledge this previous work. Discuss algorithm selection and implementation. Include any decisions about
training/validation split, regularization strategies, any optimization tricks, setting hyper-parameters, etc. It
is not necessary to provide detailed derivations for the models you use, but you should provide at least few
sentences of background (and motivation) for each model.
\section{Results} (7+sentences)
Provide results on the different models
you implemented (e.g., accuracy on the validation set, runtimes). You should report your leaderboard
test set accuracy in this section, but most of your results should be on your validation set (or from cross
validation).

%	\caption{\textbf{A comparison the plots of MSE vs beta for 60 and 160 word feature vectors.}  The other hyperparameters were not constant and needed to be changed since what worked for 60 features did not work for 160.  Despite this, what we can see is a similar behaviour and shape between the two plots but with a difference in the scale.  The rise observed in plot B was also seen in other plots of A where the values were closer to zero than the ones seen in this diagram. }
